    <p><u>Chicken</u><br>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the
      red junglefowl (Gallus
      gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
      as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011.There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or
      domesticated fowl.Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and,
      less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies.
      Chickens are omnivores.In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals
      as large as lizards, small snakes,or young mice.The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on
      the breed.The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according
      to the Guinness World Records.<br>
      <u>Beef</u><br>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been
      eating beef
      since
      prehistoric times.Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be
      used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak,
      rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef
      jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle,
      are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that
      are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen,
      glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden
      where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the
      kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky
      Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural
      sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.<br>
      <u>Sushi</u><br>Sushi, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (sushi-meshi),
      usually with
      some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally
      tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice",
      also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be
      prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel,
      yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with
      pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for
      the dish.Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly
      sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
